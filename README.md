# DeepDreams
Deep Dreams is a beautiful application of machine learning algorithms used to create dreamy , psychedelic images from real world images.
CNNs are used to find and enhance patterns to produce over processed and hellucinogenic images.
The program helps us in understanding the immense scope and creative NNs have as after training the reverse process can be achieved
yielding a high confidence score.
The optimization resembles Backpropagation , however instead of adjusting the network weights, the weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted
